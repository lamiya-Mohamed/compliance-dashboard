The dashboard visualizes **digital transformation compliance scores** for multiple entities and categorizes them into **Low, Medium, or High risk** with color-coded bars.

It demonstrates the ability to combine **data analysis**, **OOP Python**, and **interactive dashboards** to support decision-making in risk management.
